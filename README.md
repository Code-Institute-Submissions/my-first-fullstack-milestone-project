## Becks Outdoors

This is a business idea which emerged from the potential need I realize there is, in the area I live in; given the population and tourism growth we have been experiencing in the last couple of years. This project might be the starting point for a real life scenario for which an e-commerce site will be needed.

### Project purpose
The website's purpose is to serve as an online store (e-commerce website) for customers who are interested in outdoor activities such as paddleboarding, cycling and kayaking. The site serves as a one-stop online store for the items that make possible these activities.

### Functionality

### Demo
A live demo can be found [HERE](https://becks-outdoors.herokuapp.com/)

GitHub repository link can be found [HERE](https://github.com/EliBec/my-first-fullstack-milestone-project)

### UX

### User Stories
The user will be searching and hopefully purchasing an item of interest. The potential customer must find the items easily withouth the need to do too many clicks. 


**User Type (Scope)**
Given this is a site of a brick ann mortar business which also handles sales online of their inventory at the store (or drop-shipments), and as such as business, there will be visitors who are interested in visiting the physical store. So there are are 2 types of users:
1. The user who is looking for an item of interest and wishes to purchase online or at the physical store and, 
2. The user who is interested on knowing more about the businness and what it has to offer, as well as basic information such as contact information, location, etc. 

**As a user:**
- If I am a buyer I want to be able to:
1. Find the product(s) of interested easily.
2. Review the product's relavant information, such as illustrative picture, details, reviews, price and quantity
3. Be able to create a user account where my profile and shipping information can be saved and edited for future purchases
4. Easily pick product for purchase and store it on my shopping bag sesssion, so I can navigate and browse other items. Also, be able to access the shopping cart to see a list of the products I have picked so far
 as well as change the quantity right on the Shopping Cart page
5. Sort the items my price, category or brand
6. See a comprehensive list of products on the same page
7. Find Review information about the business I am considering to purchase from. 
8. Receive confirmation information on the purchase(s) I make
9. Access to my purchase history
10. Ability to book an appointment for bicycle service via the website
11. Access to the appoinments history
12. Ability to see other customer's reviews and also publish, edit or delete my review
13. I want the checkout process to be easy to follow and with a few steps. 
14. I would like to find the contact information of the business just in case I need assistance with the website or have a question about a product.

**As an Admin**
* Ability to manange products (Add, Update and Delete) on the website's front-end, so there is no need to log in to the Admin module to do so.
* If needed, I would like to be able to access the Admin module site, to manage products, users, product categories and sub-categories

**Developer:**
* As a Developer, I want to expand my knowledge with Python and DJANGO by creating an extensive management database application, including admin module
* As a Developer, I want to create a fully-responsive mobile-friendly multi-language faceted project to showcase what I have learned whilst on this course.
* As a Developer, I want a project which can evolve as I grow as a developer.
* As a Developer, I would like to extend this particular project to add the complexity of invetory management, which will be required if this business materialize

### Strategy
The website's strategy is centered in two words: simplicty and usefulness. This website is a resourceful, inconme-generating tool for a business that wishes to sell outside the walls of the physical store. 


### Structure used to help them users achieve these things:
- The website is mostly linear, with easy-to-read fonts and intuitive options to follow. 
- The website contains a separate page for each section, as opposed to a single long page. This will help he user do the task easily by placing the focus on the page's single task. 
- The header navigation bar is clipped to the top and remains that way as the user scrolls down or up, thus providing convenient way to access the pages. 
- Footer provides quick contact information. Available in all pages, the user won't need to navigate to a specific page


### Design
The website is fully responsive. To achieve this, I used [Bootstrap 4.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/)

### Font
The font-family used is 'Acme' and 'Kanit'. The Acme is used to give more emphasis to relevant information such as product name and brand. The default font is sans-serif
Acme was imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Acme?query=acme). 
Kanit was imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?query=kanit).

### Logo
Simple logo for now, emphasizing branding over illustration. it was my wish to have more time to complete the design of an alternative logo, but only counting on only 1 month to complete this project, time was the biggst factors for all the improvements I wanted to make was unable to.
To generate this logo I used [Canvas Logo Maker](https://www.canva.com/tools/logo-maker-q1/?msclkid=9d6e8ceab70a1f66065dd375c4e6f6bd&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=REV_US_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier2_EM&utm_term=canva%20logo&utm_content=REV_US_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier2_Logo_Maker_EM&gclid=CLGky_Xs4uwCFcgOgQod9RcLIg&gclsrc=ds) 


### Color Scheme
All colors were chosen using the [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel). Main colors used were green and dark brown to convey a message of nature and outdoors.

Nav color:
- ![#36A21E](https://placehold.it/15/36A21E/000000?text=+) #36A21E.

Some font color:
- ![#36250C](https://placehold.it/15/36250C/000000?text=+) #36250C

- Other colors:
  ![#008000](https://placehold.it/15/008000/000000?text=+) `Green`

- Font color: ![#fafafa](https://placehold.it/15/fafafa/000000?text=+) `#fafafa`

- Overlay: ![#CAF5C7](https://placehold.it/15/caf5c7/000000?text=+) #caf5c7

#### Tools Used:


[Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
for color picking. 

Google Chrome Dev Tools - for testing of the application's responsiveness, on-th-fly testing css editing tool and for console monitoring for Javascript and JQuery 

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for the creation of wireframes

[Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/) for the creation of a fav icon. It is not exactly the same as the logo (due to time contraints) but close enough to convey the brand.

[Free Formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html) for HTML code checking

[CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS code checking

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) for Javascript code checking

[PEP 8 Online](http://pep8online.com) for Python code checking



## Testing

Test has been performed throughtout the different stages of the website build. Responsiveness of the website has been tested using both physical devices (including smart cellphones, tablets and desktop) as well as browser tools such as Google Chrome Dev Tool.
The website has been tested on a variety of internet browsers, such as: Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Micresift Edge, Firefox and Opera to ensure compability. 

The following tools were used to ensure code quality:

For HTML: [Free Formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html)

For CSS: [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

For Javascript: [JSLint](https://jshint.com/) version 2.11.1

For Python: [PEP 8 Online](http://pep8online.com) for Python code checking


### Databases

Below are the list of models used: 

- Product Model: stores information about the product. 
- Category: stores category for a product
- Subcategory: stores a subcategory of a product
- Order: stores customer purchase information 
- OrderLine: stores product information on a order
- User Profile: stores cuatomer's account shipping information
- User (handled  by django's allauth): stores information about customer's account
- Appointment: custom model for user's appointment infomation 
- Rating: custom model for product's revew information

#### Model Relationship

PRODUCT <==> ORDER:  A product belongs to 1 order but 1 order can have many products
ORDER <==> ORDERLINEITEM: an order and have ma line items, but a line item belongs to a product
PRODUCT <==> CATEGORY: a product can belong to a single category, but a category can have many products
PRODUCT <==> SUBCATEGORY:  a product can belong to a single subcategory, but a subcategory can have many products
CATEGORY <==> SUBCATEGORY: a category can have many subcategories, but a subcategory belongs to a single category
PRODUCT <==> RATING: a product can have many ratings, but a rating can only belong to a single product

USER <==> ORDER: a user can have any orders, but an order belongs to a single user (customer)
USER <==> APPOINTMENT: a user can make many appointments, but each appointment belong to a single customer
USER <==> RATING: a user can publish many reviews (one per product) but a review belongs to a single user


#### User Experience testing: 

Testing was performed in order to verify the following:

- All links should resolve of a page (no orphans links, except to the social media icons on the footer)
- All navigation links should work
- Pages should be responsive and mostly consistent on different internet browsers
- Forms rules should be enforced (especially for required fields)

### Manual testing of all elements on all pages

The following tasks were tested:

- Live page is reachable after deployment
- User can navigate pages without page errors
- User can use the Sort By box
- User confirms Back to Top button shows up after soe scrolling down the page
- User can create, log in and log out an account. Creating an account adds a new reocrd to allauth user
- User can add, remove item(s) to the shopping cart. In shopping cart, user can update the quantity
- User can only proceed to checkout if she/he is logged in to the user account
- User is directed to an Order Confirmation page after checkout is succesful
- User receives an email confirmation after purchase is completed
- User can  process payment using the following ficticious credit card number:
   4242 4242 4242 4242 4242 (the card's zip code or expiration month and year can be anything, but make sure month and year are within the range)
- When the user checks out, a new record is created for the Order model. Each item purchased should be a new record on the Order Line Item. When the order is created, the total aount is updated
- Admin users can  Add, Delete and Edit products. These changes affect the Product model (adding, deleting or updating the record in question)
- User can update the Delivery information in the User Profile page
- User can view Order history in User Profile page
- User can only book an appointment if she/he is logged in to the user account. When a user adds an appointment, a new record in the Appointment model is created
- User can only posta review if she/he is logged in to the user account and has previusly made a purchase for the product he/she wants to post a review
- Admin users can access Django's module to perform CRUD operations on any model

#### Note:
Social media pages have not been created yet, but icons there are available on the front end.
Purchase ticket functionality has not been implemented yet, so Purchase Ticket buttons will not take the user to a purchasing page 


## Deployment


1. In heroku (heroku.com): create an app and give it a name
2. In heroku: >  create a new app > give it a new
3. In heroku:Resources tab >  Heroku Postgress > get the free version
4. In Gitpod: command line: pip3 install dj-database-url
5. In Gitpod: command line: pip3 install psycopg2-binary
6. In Gitpod: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
7. import the dj-database url in settings.py (import dj_database_url)
8. comment out the default database in settings.py and replace the values with d_database_url and config var DATABASE_URL from heroku
9. Run migrations: python3 manage.py migrate
10. Create superuser
11. Use gunicorn

### Content

- The use of the CRUD functionality was learned from the CI course. 

- Many code snippets were taken CI's project example (Boutique Ado) and modified to fit the project's case.

- Google Maps dynamic functionality code was learned from Google API and from from another student's [project](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/what2do2day) 



### Code

Some research was done using sites and learning material other than CI. There was a good aount of readon tutorials and DJANGO documentation
